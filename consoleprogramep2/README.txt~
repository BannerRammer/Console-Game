   HOW TO RUN THE GAME?
   
   Mac:
   Download the respository on github and go to terminal.
   Type in cd Desktop
   After pressing enter type in ./a.out which runs the game.

   Windows:
   Download the respository on github and go to CMD.exe or just CMD.
   Type in cd Desktop and press enter
   After pressing enter type in ./a.out which runs the game.


   For Both operating systems and if you want to run the game on a compiler.
   I recommend downloading CODE::BLOCKS or your IDE to run the game. Press on the
   green arrow which runs the game.


   If you want to run the game, do not use a NES Emulator like 
   DOSBOX. Only use for Mac Terminal and for Windows CMD.exe or CMD.
   Only terminals or a compiler like the CODE::BLOCKS compiler works.
